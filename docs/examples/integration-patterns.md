# Integration Patterns

Advanced integration patterns for connecting Semble with external systems, managing complex data flows, and implementing enterprise-grade automation solutions.

## 🏗️ Architecture Patterns

### Hub and Spoke Model

**Pattern**: Semble as central hub with multiple external systems connected through standardized interfaces.

#### Architecture Overview
```yaml
Central Hub: Semble Practice Management
├── CRM Systems (HubSpot, Salesforce)
├── Email Marketing (Mailchimp, Campaign Monitor)  
├── Calendar Systems (Google, Outlook)
├── Payment Processors (Stripe, GoCardless)
├── Communication (Twilio, Teams, Slack)
├── Analytics (Google Analytics, Mixpanel)
└── Backup Systems (Cloud Storage, Archives)

Data Flow:
  Semble → n8n → External Systems
  External Systems → n8n → Semble
  Cross-system via n8n orchestration
```

#### Implementation Strategy
```yaml
# Core integration components
Master Data: Patient records in Semble
Reference Data: Shared across all systems
Transaction Data: Originated from any system
Audit Data: Centralized logging and monitoring

# Integration layers
API Layer: RESTful and GraphQL endpoints
Transform Layer: Data mapping and conversion
Business Logic: Workflow orchestration
Monitoring Layer: Performance and error tracking
```

### Event-Driven Architecture

**Pattern**: Reactive system responding to business events across multiple platforms.

#### Event Flow Design
```yaml
Event Sources:
  - Semble API changes
  - External system webhooks
  - Scheduled time-based events
  - Manual trigger events

Event Processing:
  1. Event Detection
  2. Event Validation
  3. Event Routing
  4. Parallel Processing
  5. Result Aggregation
  6. Error Handling

Event Consumers:
  - Real-time notifications
  - Data synchronization
  - Business process automation
  - Analytics and reporting
```

#### Example Implementation
```yaml
# Patient registration event cascade
Event: New Patient Created
├── Immediate Actions (< 1 minute)
│   ├── Send welcome email
│   ├── Create CRM contact
│   └── Notify staff
├── Short-term Actions (< 1 hour)
│   ├── Schedule follow-up call
│   ├── Add to marketing sequences
│   └── Update analytics
└── Long-term Actions (< 24 hours)
    ├── Prepare welcome packet
    ├── Schedule health assessment
    └── Generate onboarding reports
```

## 🔄 Data Synchronization Patterns

### Bidirectional Sync

**Scenario**: Keep patient data synchronized between Semble and external CRM system with conflict resolution.

#### Sync Strategy
```yaml
Master Data Management:
  Patient Demographics: Semble authoritative
  Marketing Data: CRM authoritative
  Clinical Data: Semble authoritative
  Sales Data: CRM authoritative

Conflict Resolution Rules:
  1. Last-write-wins for non-critical fields
  2. Manual review for critical fields
  3. Timestamp-based priority
  4. Field-level precedence rules
```

#### Implementation Pattern
```yaml
# Semble → CRM Sync
Trigger: Semble Patient Updates
↓
Transform: Map Semble fields to CRM
↓
Validate: Check data integrity
↓
Upsert: Update or create CRM contact
↓
Log: Record sync activity
↓
Monitor: Track sync success/failure

# CRM → Semble Sync  
Trigger: CRM Contact Updates
↓
Validate: Ensure updates allowed
↓
Transform: Map CRM fields to Semble
↓
Update: Modify Semble patient
↓
Log: Record sync activity
↓
Notify: Alert if conflicts detected
```

#### Conflict Resolution Workflow
```yaml
Node: "Detect Conflicts"
Code: |
  const sembleData = $node['Semble'].json;
  const crmData = $node['CRM'].json;
  const conflicts = [];
  
  // Check critical fields for conflicts
  const criticalFields = ['email', 'phone', 'dateOfBirth'];
  
  criticalFields.forEach(field => {
    if (sembleData[field] !== crmData[field]) {
      conflicts.push({
        field,
        sembleValue: sembleData[field],
        crmValue: crmData[field],
        sembleUpdated: sembleData.dateUpdated,
        crmUpdated: crmData.lastModified
      });
    }
  });
  
  return { conflicts, hasConflicts: conflicts.length > 0 };

↓

Node: "IF" (Has Conflicts)
Condition: "{{$json.hasConflicts}}"

↓ (If True)

Node: "Create Review Task"
System: "Asana/Jira"
Task: |
  Data Sync Conflict Resolution Required
  
  Patient: {{$node['Semble'].json.firstName}} {{$node['Semble'].json.lastName}}
  Semble ID: {{$node['Semble'].json.id}}
  CRM ID: {{$node['CRM'].json.id}}
  
  Conflicts:
  {{#each $node['Detect Conflicts'].json.conflicts}}
  - {{field}}: 
    - Semble: {{sembleValue}} (updated {{sembleUpdated}})
    - CRM: {{crmValue}} (updated {{crmUpdated}})
  {{/each}}
  
  Action Required: Review and resolve conflicts manually
```

### Master Data Management

**Pattern**: Maintain data consistency across multiple systems with Semble as source of truth.

#### Data Governance Framework
```yaml
Data Stewardship:
  Clinical Data: Clinical staff ownership
  Administrative Data: Admin staff ownership
  Marketing Data: Marketing team ownership
  Financial Data: Finance team ownership

Data Quality Rules:
  - Email uniqueness enforcement
  - Phone number validation
  - Address standardization
  - NHS number verification

Data Lifecycle:
  Create → Validate → Sync → Monitor → Archive
```

#### Implementation
```yaml
# Master data validation
Node: "Data Quality Check"
Code: |
  const patient = $input.json;
  const issues = [];
  
  // Email validation
  if (!patient.email || !/\S+@\S+\.\S+/.test(patient.email)) {
    issues.push('Invalid email format');
  }
  
  // Phone validation
  if (!patient.phone || !/^\+?[\d\s\-\(\)]+$/.test(patient.phone)) {
    issues.push('Invalid phone format');
  }
  
  // NHS number validation (UK)
  if (patient.nhsNumber && !validateNHSNumber(patient.nhsNumber)) {
    issues.push('Invalid NHS number');
  }
  
  return {
    ...patient,
    dataQuality: {
      isValid: issues.length === 0,
      issues,
      score: Math.max(0, 100 - (issues.length * 20))
    }
  };

↓

Node: "Route by Quality"
Routes:
  High Quality (score >= 80): Direct sync
  Medium Quality (score >= 60): Review and sync
  Low Quality (score < 60): Manual review required
```
