## Performance and Optimization

### Query Optimization

#### Efficient Date Range Queries
```yaml
# Optimized for daily schedules
Date Range: "appointmentDate = '2024-02-20'"
Staff Filter: "staffId = 'staff_111'"
Status Filter: "status IN ['Confirmed', 'Arrived']"
Order: "appointmentTime ASC"

# Optimized for weekly planning
Date Range: "appointmentDate BETWEEN '2024-02-19' AND '2024-02-25'"
Include Status: ["Confirmed", "Pending"]
Group By: "appointmentDate, staffId"
```

#### Pagination for Large Datasets
```yaml
Small Queries: 25-50 records (daily schedules)
Medium Queries: 100-200 records (weekly planning)
Large Queries: 500+ records (reporting only)

Pagination Strategy:
  - Use cursor-based pagination for real-time data
  - Use offset pagination for reporting
  - Implement virtual scrolling for large lists
```

### Caching Strategies

#### Static Data Caching
```yaml
Appointment Types: Cache for 1 hour
Staff Schedules: Cache for 15 minutes

```

#### Dynamic Data Caching
```yaml
Daily Schedules: Cache for 2 minutes

Booking Conflicts: No caching (real-time)
Patient History: Cache for 10 minutes
```
