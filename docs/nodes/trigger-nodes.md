## Trigger Architecture

### Polling Mechanism
```yaml
# How triggers work
1. Scheduled Polling
    - n8n polls Semble API at set intervals
    - Checks for new/modified records
    - Triggers workflow execution
   
2. Change Detection
    - Compares timestamps (dateCreated, dateUpdated)
    - Identifies new records since last poll
    - Tracks modification patterns
   
3. Workflow Execution
    - Passes data to next workflow node
    - Includes metadata about changes
    - Enables conditional logic
```

### Polling Configuration
```yaml
# Interval options
Poll Intervals:
  - "Every 5 minutes"     # Real-time monitoring
  - "Every 15 minutes"    # Standard monitoring  
  - "Every 30 minutes"    # Regular checking
  - "Every 1 hour"        # Periodic updates
  - "Every 4 hours"       # Low-frequency monitoring
  - "Daily"              # Batch processing

# Performance considerations
Recommended Intervals:
  - Emergency workflows: 5-15 minutes
  - Business workflows: 15-30 minutes
  - Reporting workflows: 1-4 hours
  - Archive workflows: Daily
```

### Date Period Configuration
```yaml
# Lookback periods
Date Periods:
  - "Last 1 hour"        # Recent changes only
  - "Last 4 hours"       # Half-day monitoring
  - "Last 24 hours"      # Daily changes
  - "Last 7 days"        # Weekly review
  - "Last 30 days"       # Monthly analysis
  - "Custom range"       # Specific dates
  
# Startup behavior
First Execution:
  - Default: Last 24 hours
  - Configurable: Custom lookback
  - Safety: Prevents overwhelming with historical data
```

# Monitor related events across resources
Trigger 1: New Patient Registration
Trigger 2: New Booking for New Patients
‚Üì
Combined Logic:
- If new patient registers
- AND books appointment within 24 hours
- THEN apply "new patient package" discount
- AND send enhanced welcome sequence
```

#### Cross-System Synchronization
```yaml
# Keep multiple systems in sync
Semble Changes ‚Üí Update External Systems

Patient Triggers:
  ‚Üí Update CRM (HubSpot/Salesforce)
  ‚Üí Sync email marketing (Mailchimp)

```

### Conditional Trigger Logic

#### Time-Based Conditions
```yaml
Business Hours Logic:
  IF trigger_time BETWEEN 09:00 AND 17:00:
    ‚Üí Process immediately
  ELSE:
    ‚Üí Queue for next business day
    
Weekend Logic:
  IF day_of_week IN ['Saturday', 'Sunday']:
    ‚Üí Emergency notifications only
  ELSE:
    ‚Üí Full workflow processing
    
Holiday Logic:
  IF date IN holiday_calendar:
    ‚Üí Reduced automation
    ‚Üí Emergency workflows only
```

#### Priority-Based Processing
```yaml
High Priority Triggers:
  - Emergency appointments
  - VIP patient changes
  - Critical system alerts
  ‚Üí Process: Immediately
  ‚Üí Notification: SMS + Email
  
Standard Priority:

  - Normal patient updates
  - Routine product changes
  ‚Üí Process: Within poll interval
  ‚Üí Notification: Email only
  
Low Priority:
  - Bulk updates
  - Historical corrections
  - Archive operations
  ‚Üí Process: During off-hours
  ‚Üí Notification: Daily summary
```

### Error Handling and Recovery

#### Retry Logic
```yaml
Failed Trigger Processing:
  Attempt 1: Immediate retry
  Attempt 2: 5-minute delay
  Attempt 3: 15-minute delay
  Attempt 4: 1-hour delay
  Attempt 5: Manual intervention
  
Error Categories:
  Temporary Network: Auto-retry
  API Rate Limit: Exponential backoff
  Data Validation: Manual review
  System Maintenance: Pause until available
```

#### Failure Notifications
```yaml
Critical Failures:
